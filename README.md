## Requirements ##
- Java 7 - https://www.java.com/download/
- Chrome - https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/

## Notes ##
- The first run will take some time and might error (requiring a restart). The program runs chrome on separate profile which needs to be set up.
- Changing users will require a restart, the program stores the user ID to filter messages from the game.
- This has only been tested on my computer, I'm sure there will be bugs.
